# Assignment 01 - Interactive Personality
By Rebecca Malagisi

Try to clear as many rectangles as possible by clicking them, but it may be harder than it seems. 

*** Don’t forget to scroll.

*** Use volume.

For years, I've used the web as an escape, in a sense. I would mindlessly scroll through social media sites, consuming content that others would post, not really truly participating or sharing anything of my own. Due to this, I would consider my online presence as quite passive, though some could say it is somewhat interactive as well, as I am still constantly interacting with the web, despite it not being the most productive interactions. I am consumed by the web, but I feel like it has almost become negative to me now. The web, though one of the best tools for discovery, has become one of the greatest tools for distractions in my life. Instead of getting a head start on homework assignments and projects, I waste hours, if not days, looking at videos on youtube, scrolling through tumblr, twitter, etc. I abuse the internet in order to avoid my responsibilities, which has become quite a problem in my life.

Therefore, my concept for this assignment was to create a distracting website that keeps the user busy for a few minutes, essentially wasting their time when they should be doing other work. 

A for loop causes rectangles appear on the webpage every 2.5 seconds. The user would interact with the rectangles on the page, trying to clear them by clicking on them. However, whenever the user hovers over the rectangles, they move down the page, evading the clicks on the user. Difficulty levels to successfully clear a rectangle vary, in which the ones with a shorter height are most difficult to click on. With rectangles constantly being added, the user would start to feel overwhelmed and would cause the user to become frustrated with the webpage. In addition, after certain intervals of time (initially 1 minute, and then every 15 seconds), phrases such as “You’re wasting time” are spoken using the ResponsiveVoice JavaScript plugin, mimicking your own thoughts when you know you should not be procrastinating. Both the nagging vocal updates and the frustration caused by trying to clear the rectangles create a very stress-inducing experience (hopefully).
